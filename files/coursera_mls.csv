Whole genome sequencing of bacterial genomes - tools and applications,Technical University of Denmark (DTU),"This course will cover the topic of  Whole genome sequencing (WGS)  of bacterial genomes which is becoming more and more relevant for the medical sector.  WGS technology and applications are high on international political agenda, as the classical methods are being replaced by WGS technology and therefore bioinformatic tools are extremely important for allowing the people working in this sector to be able to analyze the data and obtain results that can be interpreted and used for different purposes. The course will give the learners a basis to understand and be acquainted with WGS applications in surveillance of bacteria including species identification, typing and characterization of antimicrobial resistance and virulence traits as well as plasmid characterization. It will also give the opportunity to learners to learn about online tools and what they can be used for through demonstrations on how to use some of these tools and exercises to be solved by learners with use of freely available WGS analysis tools .","41,760","1,242"
"Faster Together, Enhancing the Recruitment of Minorities in Clinical Trials",Vanderbilt University,"This course aims to teach people how to enhance the recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials.  Key topics include the importance of diversity in clinical trials, barriers and facilitators to participation in clinical research, community engagement, effective communication, educating about clinical trials, provider outreach, effective prescreening and enrollment, person-centered consent, and retention.  Anyone with the potential to recruit can benefit from this course, whether working in a clinical setting or in the community.  ","3,126",89
"Anatomy of the Chest, Neck, Abdomen, and Pelvis",Yale University,"Human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us – physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.

Learning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.

In this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.

All of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.

The sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  

We hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.

ANATOMY OF THE CHEST, NECK, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F. SWENSEN FUND FOR INNOVATION IN TEACHING.

Copyright for Educators & Librarians,Duke University,Fear and uncertainty about copyright law often plagues educators and sometimes prevents creative teaching.  This course is a professional development opportunity designed to provide a basic introduction to US copyright law and to empower teachers and librarians at all grade levels. Course participants will discover that the law is designed to help educators and librarians.,"16,504",515
High Level Biocontainment for Healthcare Facilities,University of Nebraska,"The goal of this 4-week course is to equip learners to safely care for a patient infected with a pathogen requiring high-level biocontainment.  This can be accomplished in any healthcare facility given the correct approach and protocols.

Please copy and paste the following link into a new tab/browser to view the video overview of our course.  http://bit.ly/2bPZ6Cz 

In this course, we will:
  1.  Discuss the essentials of intake screening.
  2.  Investigate pathogen transmission characteristics and the chain of infection.
  3.  Examine patient placement in a facility, as well as the engineering/ administrative controls. 
  4.  Review personal protective equipment worn by the care providers.
  5.  Evaluate waste management and decontamination protocols.


We look forward to exploring and learning with you!

Copyright for Multimedia,Duke University,"Copyright questions about different formats (data, images, music and video) can be especially difficult.  Sometimes the law specifically distinguishes between these different formats, and in most cases there are media-specific considerations that impact a copyright analysis.  In this course we will look at four different media, paying special attention to the unique issues for each one and the kinds of information that is important when making copyright decisions for each type of material.  We will work through fair use issues for each multimedia format, look at format-specific exceptions in the law, and consider unique issues for seeking permission for film, music, images and data.

At the end of this course, participants will have a deeper understanding of how to apply our framework for making copyright decisions, and will be more comfortable with assessing multimedia issues.  They will have gained more and more diverse experience for considering fair use.","20,505",381
