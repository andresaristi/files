"Foundations of Sports Analytics: Data, Representation, and Models in Sports",University of Michigan,"This course provides an introduction to using Python to analyze team performance in sports. Learners will discover a variety of techniques that can be used to represent sports data and how to extract narratives based on these analytical techniques. The main focus of the introduction will be on the use of regression analysis to analyze team and player performance data, using examples drawn from the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL), the English Premier LEague (EPL, soccer) and the Indian Premier League (IPL, cricket). 

This course does not simply explain methods and techniques, it enables the learner to apply them to sports datasets of interest so that they can generate their own results, rather than relying on the data processing performed by others.  As a consequence the learning will be empowered to explore their own ideas about sports team performance, test them out using the data, and so become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer.

While the course materials have been developed using Python, code has also been produced to derive all of the results in R, for those who prefer that environment.","11,247",118

Sports and Society,Duke University,"Sports play a giant role in contemporary society worldwide. But few of us pause to think about the larger questions of money, politics, race, sex, culture, and commercialization that surround sports everywhere. This course draws on the tools of anthropology, sociology, history, and other disciplines to give you new perspectives on the games we watch and play.  It's the new and improved version of Professor Orin Starn's original ""Sports and Society"" for Coursera, which drew more than 40,000 students.  We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or “football,” as anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also lesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing.  You will never watch or think about sports in the same way again.","27,689","1,120"
Sustainability through Soccer: Systems-Thinking in Action,University of Virginia,"This course takes learners on a journey through a progression of systems-thinking and sustainability concepts. Using the beautiful game of soccer (also known as football in many parts of the world) as an analogy, we'll work together to illuminate real-world interdependencies (such as between climate change and human rights), building the chain of concepts in a fun, accessible way. Soccer/Football nerds and newbies alike will be entertained and, ultimately, rewarded with the epiphanies that come from seeing in systems more clearly.

Those who complete the course will: create examples of systems parts, boundaries, and behaviors related to sustainability (and soccer/football); practice evaluating the sustainability of systems they care about using several complementary methods; generate ideas to improve the sustainability of a system they care about; and explain a mindset shift that would enhance the sustainability of a system they care about.","3,711",37
Cyber Threats and Attack Vectors,University of Colorado System,"Data breaches occur nearly every day.  From very large retailers, down to your fantasy football website, and anywhere in between, they have been compromised in some way.  How did the attackers get in?  What did they do with the data they compromised?  What should I be concerned with in my own business or my systems?  This course is the second course in the Practical Computer Security.  It will discuss types of threats and attack vectors commonly seen in today’s environment.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but threats are all over the place!  This course isn’t designed to insight fear that there is no hope for keeping systems and business secure, but rather educate you on how attacks are carried out so that you have a better sense of what to look out for in your business or with your systems.","28,625",637
"Dopage : Sports, Organisations et Sciences",University of Lausanne,"L'objectif du cours est de permettre une compréhension distanciée du dopage. C’est pour atteindre cet objectif que le cours s’appuie sur une approche pluridisciplinaire qui constitue une opportunité d'observer comment diverses disciplines abordent un même objet, selon différents angles et de manière complémentaire. Il s'agit également de donner des repères permettant d'appréhender le dopage dans sa complexité.

Le dopage dans le sport est une pratique complexe dont la définition et l'identification renvoient à la construction sociale et historique de normes. 

Le cours propose une clarification des processus qui ont conduit à l'usage et la prohibition des produits dopants. L'amélioration des performances ou les transformations des apparences sont deux aspects du dopage qui dérangent alors que pourtant les sociétés vantent les mérites de ""l'amélioration"" du corps et que les marchés du ""human enhancement"" prospèrent. Ces apparentes contradictions seront analysées en montrant que, au-delà des questions sanitaires, le dopage est au croisement de multiples enjeux sociaux, scientifiques ou encore juridiques.

Pour y faire face, les autorités sportives et étatiques ont contribué à la mise en place d’institutions en charge de l'identification du dopage, de politiques de prévention, de répression et de recherche. Les dispositifs biologiques de contrôle comme le passeport biologique, les dimensions juridiques qui fondent la lutte contre le dopage, les organisations de production de la performance, comme les dimensions sociologiques du dopage seront abordés par ce cours.

Outre les enseignants de l’Université de Lausanne, les meilleurs spécialistes du dopage, d’un laboratoire antidopage (LAD), du TAS (Tribunal Arbitral du Sport), de l’UEFA (football) et de l’AMA (Agence Mondiale Antidopage) interviennent dans ce cours. 

Teaser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ZQVQsWAdo 

Objectifs pédagogiques principaux :

A la fin de ce cours les participants seront capables de:

1. Identifier la dimension « culturelle » du dopage, c’est-à-dire comme pratique qui a une histoire en lien avec la transformation de normes sociales

2. Passer d’un mode de raisonnement binaire sur le dopage, pour ou contre, à la compréhension de la complexité d’un phénomène à la fois biologique, psychologique et sociologique

3. Reconnaître les institutions, les acteurs et les pratiques de lutte contre le dopage

4. Expliquer comment le contexte social et organisationnel pèse sur les décisions des individus et comment il peut être réduit par des mesures de prévention. 

5. Identifier comment fonctionne la lutte contre le dopage et les procédures de contrôle","4,849",146

"Energy, Environment, and Everyday Life",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,"This course teaches you everything you need to know about energy, the environment, and at least a number of things in everyday life. It starts by talking about energy itself and where it comes from. This includes how much we have, who has it, who uses it, and what that all means. The video clips are produced in a fast-paced multimedia format during which Professor Ruzic throws in fun and demonstrations. There are multiple-choice questions to check your understanding and some more in-depth exercises to guide you deeper into the subject.

After explaining the main things we use energy for – our cars and electronics! – fossil fuels are examined in detail. Want to really learn about fracking or pipelines? Watch these segments. The environmental effects of fossil fuels are taught as well. Global warming, acid rain, and geoengineering all are in this part of the course. Part of their solution is too. Renewables follow, with clips on solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels, etc. You’ll even see Professor Ruzic in a corn field and in the middle of a stream showing how you could dam it up.

Finally, nuclear power is taught in detail – how it really works and what happens when it doesn’t work, as in Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, as well as how we are making it today, which is shown here without political preconceptions. In this course, economics takes center stage. People will ultimately do whatever costs the least, so energy policy is most effective when it is targeted at the user’s wallet.

Throughout the course there are 24 segments on “How Things Work."" These guides to everyday life are tremendously varied, covering everything from fireworks to making beer to what happens backstage at a theater. The course is designed to be enjoyable as well as informative. We hope you will take a look!","19,331",192
Activism in Sports and Culture,Morehouse College,"Sports have become an ever-present reflection of American culture, and an important symbol of the divisions and alliances in our society. Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports. 

How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space — or doesn't — for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they ""shut up and dribble""? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. 

Your professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today.",0,11

Enjoyable Econometrics,Erasmus University Rotterdam,"The goal of this MOOC is to show that econometric methods are often needed to answer questions. A question comes first, then data are to be collected, and then finally the model or method comes in. Depending on the data, however, it can happen that methods need to be adapted. For example, where we first look at two variables, later we may need to look at three or more. Or, when data are missing, what then do we do? And, if the data are counts, like the number of newspaper articles citing someone, then matters may change too. But these modifications always come last, and are considered only when relevant.

Designing Autonomous AI,University of Washington,"When children learn how to hit a baseball, they don’t start with fastballs. Their coaches begin with the basics: how to grip the handle of the bat, where to put their feet and how to keep their eyes on the ball. Similarly, an autonomous AI system needs a subject matter expert (SME) to break a complex process or problem into easier tasks that give the AI important clues about how to find a solution faster.  

In this course, you’ll learn how to distill a business challenge into its component parts by creating an autonomous AI design plan. Using lessons, goal setting, skills, strategies and rewards, you’ll incorporate your SME’s knowledge directly into your AI’s “brain,” the agent that powers your autonomous system. You'll learn when and how to combine various AI architecture design patterns, as well as how to design an advanced AI at the architectural level without worrying about the implementation of neural networks or machine learning algorithms. 

At the end of this course, you’ll be able to: 
•  Interview SMEs to extract their unique knowledge about a system or process  
•  Combine reinforcement learning with expert rules, optimization and mathematical calculations in an AI brain 
•  Design an autonomous AI brain from modular components to guide the learning process for a particular task 
•. Validate your brain design against existing expertise and techniques for solving problems 
•  Produce a detailed specifications document so that someone else can build your AI brain 

This course is part of a specialization called Autonomous AI for Industry, which will launch in fall 2022.",0,0
